La Lettre Gerber zipped file is now release for public.  The current revision for this pcb is REV 2.  PLEASE AT YOUR OWN RISK! I have not send the gerber files to JLCPCB for print yet due to resource contraints.  But the pcb should work.  All tracings were done by EasyEDA auto trace and DRC found no errors.  Please do not come crying to me if the print fails.  You are free to modify or whatever.  I will try to find a way to get the pcb file from EasyEDA since the app uses different method than standard KiCad.  The pcb WILL NOT FIT somepin's La Lettre handwire case file. You will have to modify his step file to fit.  I will include the dxf that was used for the pcb creation.  I may or may not support make revisions or support the improvement of this pcb in the future as this was a request by a friend and my focus is currently on my own designs.

The mcu for my conversion of La Lettre handwire to pcb is Waveshare RP2040 Zero. So Pro Micro will definitely not work unless you mickey mouse handwire to make it work but that's another subject for another time.  As for the firmware https://github.com/protieusz/la-lettre/tree/main/pcb%20firmware the RP2040 version has already been compiled and I have also included the source code if you want to edit.  Good luck to all and have fun.
