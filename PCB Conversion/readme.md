# La Lettre PCB Version

This is a La Lettre pcb version that was converted from the handwired version done by [somepin](https://github.com/somepin/la-lettre). Currently the overall pcb design is finished but I will add some finishing touches and waiting to print probably in the month of May 2023.  I am currently hosting a mini group buy to recover my costs and time of designing.  Currently all 5 pcbs prints have been "reserved".  If more people are interested, then they can DM me on discord, Protieus #7690.  Once my quota of cost have been reached, I will release the gerber files to public.

The mcu that is used for the design is the Waveshare RP2040 Zero.  However, I am not sure if the new mcu will "fit" into somepin's case design since I have not got a chance to look at his case nor test it out. So please use at your own risk. Somepin have included step files for his La Lettre case so you can modify to your own desire to fit my pcb design.  The pcb shape is the same exact unsplit version switch plate of the La Lettre.  The layout is pretty much the same with the option of adding your rotary encoder at the lazy "B" key switch area.  

I will generate the firmware when I send my gerbers for print.

Here are some pictures as a preview.
